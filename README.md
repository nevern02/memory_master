# Memory Master

Memory Master is a card matching game in the style of the classic ["Concentration"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game\)).  It's an HTML5 application targetting modern browsers, and currently has build targets for the web and the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memory-master/cmhijgcjdhjlklainhonijjncaklooai).  The game is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)).  The project is primarily an excuse to explore various front-end tools and Chrome APIs.
